nba,reminder this raptors playoff run would not be possible without andrea bargnani
nba,i have followed baseball for quite a while. there are four memorable chokes in the 21st century postseason namely the 2002 choke of sf giants 2003 choke of chicago cubs  both under dusty baker 2004 choke of ny yankees joe torre and 2011 choke of texas rangers ron washington . each time they got very close to winning the world series or reaching there but choked for a variety of reasons. none of the managers named above every got close to their glory. dusty baker was solid but never reached world series; ditto to joe torre a yankees legendary manager but ending his career with a whimper. ron washington got into some sex issue and disappeared. no team which got so close to winning and let it slip to its fingers ever recovers. sf giants won its world series in 2010 chicago cubs finally in 2016 ny yankees 2009. texas rangers is still far away from reaching the world series. all with different managers. === the imperative is that nick nurse will choke the raptors will return to jurassic park and never hard again kawhi will leave and curry will win the nba final mvp. durant will be credited cheered and forgotten. after one year of paying him 31m as a bonus for the championship he will be let go become a journeyman and will probably not enter the hall of fame like derrick rose. many years later when the gs warriors might need some image changes he will be given some title to become a spokesman for the team. the curry-thompson team who will continue to be dominant will enter to the pantheon of basketball like jordan and pippen. that is the high probability outcome. there might be exceptions to this scenario but it is the most likely one.

liverpool,alex oxlade-chamberlain liverpool fc and england international playing 
nba,i dont think losing 2 timeouts is a good enough reason. the raptors had so much momentum and kawhi was hot. they are up 6 and he calls a timeout. only way that works is if they come out of the timeout with a good play and easy bucket to go up 8 but they dont no play at all then they fail to score the majority of their remaining possessions. the raptors literally iced themselves. the warriors had one timeout left and if the raptors kept the momentum going it would ve forced the warriors in a touch position. that was so hard to watch. not to mention the last play was horrid. edit based on comments below it sounds like the players called it. if they felt tired then okay that s fine. but they definitely didnt not bring any efficiency or scoring to the offense after that.

nba,it s deep enougZw dramatic this thread is and how everyone is jumping to massive conclusions and switching sides just because they are on the other side of the fence. yes it was disgusting to see but when massive crowds get together for such moments it s very typical for that snowball effect to take place and people joining cheers. i m pretty sure most regretted it and felt bad once they understood what really transpired .following the kd chants and etc. y all need to relax. plus kd is a true warrior dude showed zero facial expression of pain or otherwise which probably made people assume he s just not ready to play instead of being physically hurt or worsening the injury. i don t support what happened but everyone switching sides or praying for the downfall of raptors is same cloth mentality. p.s. not really here to defend or justify but it s just easy to see how it transpired the way it did if you know anything about psychology and crowds.

nba,sports forums are flooded with comments today about how terrible it was that the golden state medical team cleared durant to play. the last comment i read was the entire staff be fired. kd should not have played last night - period. i m sure a bunch of you made comments that durant shouldn t have been cleared to play and even if he had been he should have chosen to sit the game out. now fall back to last year. the spurs doctors medically cleared kawhi to play. he said he was still in pain and that his private doctor said he was still injured. fans on this subsection and in every sports forum absolutely crucified kawhi. sports talk radio hosts destroyed him. said he had no heart no loyalty was a cancer .and of course that he was overrated. even coach pop and a couple of his teammates ripped kawhi apart in interviews. so it is interesting to see the different narrative here.  also on a side note it is also funny how fickle nba fans are. a year ago almost all of you hated kawhi .but after this nba playoffs he s become one of the 2-3 most loved players in the world. a week ago everybody who wasn t a golden state fan hated durant nick named the snake .but he gets hurt and now everybody loves him one dude on reddit actually said durant risked it all  ..dude is a pro athlete with a couple hundred million dollars in the bank will miss one year where he will still get paid 31 million dollars and will still come back and no doubt be an all star and get a huge contract. risked it all he didn t go off to fight a war or he didn t jump in the middle of a grizzly bear mauling his friend. he chose to play a basketball game. trust me kd will be alright. lots of athletes get injured and miss time. and yes downvote me all you want. you know everything i said was true. the same people destroying kawhi last year are now destorying gs s medical staff. too funny.

nba,celtics and kyrie - we could say kyrie burned a bridge here but if he makes new promises to be a leader and to stick it out wouldn t boston welcome him back  additionally a move to the nets or knicks for him without another all-star puts him into same situation lbj was in is it worth punting on a season of his prime to attract 2020 fa s if kyrie does re-sign in boston la and everyone else can kiss their ad hopes away. clippers - not much has changed they re only real play here is kawhi now and just focus on their core. unless you really want to believe in jimmy butler being the alpha for the clipper dogs.  knicks \- by god these are literally the ned starks of the league. worst luck imaginable. the knicks will have to throw a max at kd possibly trade their pieces for ad and hope that they can sell ad and any other fa s on another year to wait for kd s return from injury. that is a tall order. alternatively they can ride their hopes on rj s development and perhaps kevin knox can aspire to be more than a squire.  the ad/nola fiasco - quite possibly the biggest winners from all this. with kd out for what should be most of the year in the west many more wc teams can put together packages for an ad deal. namely blazers and the nuggets. nola still has the luxury of moving him out east too to knicks/nets and boston. nola is sitting on a great place to be for a trade.  lakers - this is a double edged sword. do they outbid all offers and give up their core and picks for ad or do they capitalize on kd s absence and ride it out with their core and wait for 2020 lakers can now afford to gamble on the health and development of their players since the core +lebron if healthy should be able to challenge gsw on paper granted they rebuilt their roster right. however that plan fails if anyone of the key young guys or lbj gets injured. on the bright side lbj can recruit kd for some appearances in space jam 2 since he ll have the time.  warriors - this is heavy. if kd opts in do they really want to go through another year of both no kd and no depth alternatively if he does bolt for another team they could very well return to 2016 form with the cap space to build their depth again. do they gamble on kd and hope steph/klay/dray can carry to another wcf berth with poor depth   so many narratives at play how do you think this will end

nba,so i know demarcus cousins is easy to make fun of but the people making fun of how he played down the stretch last night are ridiculous and honestly i don t think they know basketball. 1. he was fantastic last night. an efficient 14 and 6 in 20 minutes is awesome. i honestly thought he could have taken a few more jumpers in the 4th to spread the floor but overall he had a great game and provided a huge lift after kd went down. 2. the guy is still injured. this is a similar injury to what oladipo and kawhi had. 3. i would say 2 out of the 3 calls against him were either bad luck or a bad call. the goaltending on lowry was definitely a goaltending and the right call. honestly he should never guard a pg straight up so i put that on kerr i know it s a switch and all that but still i think that s a scheme issue not a cousins issue . the offensive basket interference was a millisecond from being the best play of the game. certain angles almost made it look like he timed it perfectly but i do think he was there barely early so i am going to chalk that up to bad luck. honestly if the refs hadn t called it and went back to review it may have held up as a tip slam. also offensive basket interference isn t that big of a deal to get it called on you. it just gives the other team a defensive rebound really. the third play which was garbage was the moving screen. that whistle should have been swallowed. i bet we saw that screen 50 times in the game and they decide to call it in the final 20 seconds. pretty much every screen in the nba is a moving screen. i never thought i d be a cousins apologist but the guy deserves a crazy amount of praise for how he played last night and i want him to get his credit.
nba,i think the cases of kd it and kawhi show that in the long run you are better off ignoring the media team officials and even team mates regarding injury and rehab.

nba,in game 5 steph curry passed some notable greats in finals scoring.
nba,the most common defense i ve seen for the timeout is the fact that the raps would ve lost their timeouts so it was a use it or lose it situation and they used it and inadvertently iced their own team. that said there is an automatic tv timeout at the 3 6 and 9 mins to go marks of the 4th quarter with the one at the 3 mins to go mark always being an official s timeout and not charged to a team. so the first dead ball after the 3 min mark the warriors would ve had a tv timeout to regroup. as such even if the raps don t take that timeout themselves and go through with that possession the likely outcome of the situation is that the warriors still having two fouls to give at that point pick up one during the raps next trip down the floor to force a dead ball and the tv timeout. so the warriors would ve had a free chance to regroup regardless the only question being if that one extra possession in between could ve been enough to swing things. i don t know how accurate this is since that s my understanding of how tv timeouts work even though there have been rule changes in the past few years regarding timeouts no more 20 s for example . that said i feel like people are overlooking this if it is the case.
nba,nba broadcast for the first time in punjabi in canada

nba,paraphrased one section in title. in the latest podcast nate duncan outlines a few of the issues surrounding putting kd on the court last night. it s a great listen and i ve transcribed below the segment that deals with this removed a ums etc. or anywhere i was unaware of what was being said ie. one writer s name dunc d on podcast - 2019 nba finals game 5 kd injury   .spreaker.com/user/10451190/duncd-on-190611-final_1 gt;so a number of articles came out ¦ amick went further saying there was frustration among the warriors  players ¦. there definitely were warriors  players carping to the media about the fact that kd was not back yet - and a lot of people saying on social media  ˜oh because he wanted to be a free agent  and  ˜why even bother coming back at all  and painting him as a malinger and  ˜he didn t even want to come back  and all this so it s rare that i ll do this but let me play this clip here from yesterday s show  gt;every single time just about that people whether it s teammates whether its the media whatever question a guy for supposedly being a malinger and being healthy and not playing it just hasn t ended up well whether it s bill walton whether it s loul deng in 2009 when he turned out to have a stress fracture in his leg whether it was kawhi last year especially someone like kevin durant - you only have so many times in your life you can play in an nba finals - it s one thing if its like jerome james who just had one hot playoffs and then got a big deal and then didn t want to play anymore. kevin durant clearly loves basketball that s what he lives for - i would be really really surprised if he is healthy enough to play and just not doing it. so is this enough now can we stop doing this thing where we question whether guys are actually healthy enough to play when they sit out and i don t know what was said by the warriors and their doctors to kd i don t know if they put pressure on him directly certainly kd reads the media. gt;it was quite obvious just from watching him that he wasn t entirely comfortable pushing off of that calf and then i thought knowing what the risk was to him or maybe that he just wasn t 100% because it was said - slater had this  ˜if this were the regular season it would be another week or two before he came back  and so if that s the case you have to put him in positions where he s not going to stress that out and that s something that could have or should have been communicated to him as well duncan talking re person experience with calf injury ¦ once i saw kd bringing the ball up and getting pressured up at half court one time he tried to get by siakim and siakim got called for a foul but he clearly didn t feel comfortable trying to push off and go by him and then they did it again and they switched and they put ibaka on him and ibaka is pressuring up and that s what led to the injury. anybody should know this before the game that when you put him in situations where he s facing the basket where he really has to push off by pushing that right leg behind him you re putting him into a difficult position that maybe it s not a question of reinjury but he s not going to be able to do that really well and so to call plays where he s bringing the ball up floor was really just not smart at all. and you don t know that this is what s going to happen but put him in the post - the one time they put him in the post he got double teamed have him come off a screen - they did that once and have him be a spot up shooter and maybe as he works into the game which he did to some degree you can try some of that other stuff but curry was out of the game they felt like they wanted to have him handle the ball but the way he looked i really thought that was not a good decision. and maybe he said  ˜alright i m fine i can do that  between him and then  he s cleared so you want to say  ˜oh its kd  he s back we re gonna just do the normal stuff  but that seemed really short sighted to me and i was saying that live on the show before the injury happened - that it just really didn t make sense to use him that way. gt;sliding your feet jumping off you re feet you re fine there. that s much easier and really you don t necessarily need to make that kind of a motion that often. yeah he s not gonna be 1000% kd but putting him into that situation where he s pressured up - and credit the raptors for - and they ve done this all series - for making nothing easy for him either. i don t credit them for injuring him but for making him work. that was a great philosophy for them. __they go onto touch on how with a muscle injury your other areas are overcompensating so there s risk in pushing it back__ _interesting observations all around - may edit some if i find typos_

liverpool,simple question who is your favorite player in the liverpool squad right now 
nba,the nba finals are not the only basketball finals going on right now. game 1 of the greek basket league finals has just finished with panathinaikos beating promitheas 101-77. the series is expected to be a 3-0 sweep for the greens and finished the regular season with a 24-2 record. but i m not here to talk much about what is happening on the court. this season has seen so much going on outside of the game itself and it s a drama that you really could never see happening in the nba. background the greek basket league is dominated by two clubs since the 90s olympiacos  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olympiacos_b.c.  aka osfp legend the red and white and panathinaikos  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panathinaikos_b.c.  aka pao the greens . these two clubs have cemented their status on the back of their euroleague participation which brings in a lot of revenue and the heated rivalry the two clubs share across multiple sports. no other team comes close to these two in the last 25 seasons only 1 time has a team other than these two won the title and only 7 times has the final not been played between them. you have to go back to 2004 to find the last time any another team made the final. as a side note the clubs are coached by david blatt and rick pitino respectively. this year olympiacos missed the final in spectacular fashion. but there was no historic upset victory by a lower seeded team which got them there. instead what happened is unheard of in the history of world basketball and it may get olympiacos kicked out of the league entirely. we can t participate in this absurdity. separate from the regular season greece holds a competition called the greek cup similar to cup competitions in football/soccer. for those unfamiliar imagine a march madness-type competition where every team from the nba d-league all the way down to the your local rec league were put into one bracket. olympiacos and panathinaikos were set to meet in the semifinals of this competition. the full match can be seen here   .youtube.com/watch v=r-n6ojcyw0w . olympiacos found themselves in foul trouble early with 3 fouls called against them in just 30 seconds. olympiacos were humiliated throughout the first half and found themselves down 40-25 at halftime. after the typical 10 minutes panathinaikos come back on for the half-time shootaround. but olympiacos are nowhere to be found. there is speculation that perhaps the team is going to forfeit. eventually  at 1 07 25 in the video a countdown clock starts counting down how long the team have left to come on. what happens next is peak absurdity. there is an interview with the panathinaikos gm 1 02 30 . he accuses them of planning to forfeit ahead of time. it s possible that their players are unpaid they forfeited and now they say that they hate the refs. maybe the owners wants to sell olympiacos and throw it all at us and the refs.  later to olympiacos general manager at 1 10 00  christos stavropoulos. we have said it again and again and again. he blames the referees for the state of this game and says we can t participate anymore in this absurdity we can t take it any more the federation and president should clean up the stink in the game it s over.  when asked about his sending a letter to fiba to pay special attention to the game tonight implying that he planned the forfeit ahead of time stavropoulos denies it. the ultimate hilarious ending to this night involved the panathinaikos gm leaving a pair of womens underwear on the visiting teams bench  images.eurohoops.net/2019/02/acc55eda-trakis-string-625x375.jpg . as a result of this match panathinaikos are awarded a 20-0 forfeit win in the cup and olympiacos are deducted 8 points in the regular season standings equivalent to turning 4 wins into losses - a big penalty considering it is a 26 game season . escalation fast-forward to the last game in the regular season both teams playing in meaningless games against lower-ranked teams. olympiacos have found out that the same referee crew from the cup semifinal were assigned to their regular season game. they announced they would forfeit the game. greek league rules say that any team forfeiting 2 games in a season or a single playoff game gets kicked out of the league and sent to the second division. so if olympiacos were to forfeit this they would jeopardize not only their place in the greek league but in euroleague who has in the past kicked teams out for poor domestic league placing. separately the night before the match a mob of olympiacos fans showed up to the referees house chanting abuse and threats toward him. he refused to referee the match and the referees union demanded a change in the officials for this game which ultimately occurred. the game went on as normal. in response and as a protest panathinaikos forfeited their game and faced a points deduction of their own. the points deductions meant panathinakos was the 3rd seed and olympiacos the 6th seed in an 8 team playoff. which meant they would be meeting not in the final as they usually do but in the first round. the derby that wasn t in a move that federation certainly took to cement their authority over the clubs the same refereeing crew from the teams cup meeting was assigned to their first round matchup. olympiacos was expected to forfeit once again unless the referees were changed and panathinakos threatened to forfeit if they were changed. ultimately they were not changed and olympiacos forfeited their playoff series. olympiacos are now expected to be relegated to the second division and their status in the euroleague is uncertain. in the meantime the team have applied to join another league the aba which includes teams from serbia croatia etc. it is not likely they will be approved.
