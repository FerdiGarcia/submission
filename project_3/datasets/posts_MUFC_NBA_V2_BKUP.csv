This phrase/nicknames that I have seen more than a multitude of times is one of the least relevant phrases I  ve ever seen. Is it just me  What  s worse in my opinion is when I have seen this phrase all I have witnessed is Melo joining teams and getting cut. Poor Melo. Maybe he can shoot 40 + from three next year and make a comeback. 
Anyways isn  t it surprising that Carmelo was an Allstar just two years ago

1317,t3_bzdiis,r/nba, **Celtics and Kyrie -**  We could say Kyrie burned a bridge here, but if he makes new promises to be a leader and to stick it out, wouldn t Boston welcome him back   Additionally, a move to the Nets or Knicks for him without another all-star puts him into same situation LBJ was in, is it worth punting on a season of his prime to attract 2020 FA s  If Kyrie does re-sign in Boston, LA and everyone else can kiss their AD hopes away.   


**Clippers -** Not much has changed, they re only real play here is Kawhi now, and just focus on their core. Unless you really want to believe in Jimmy Butler being the alpha for the Clipper dogs.   


**Knicks** \- by god these are literally the Ned Starks of the League. Worst luck imaginable. The Knicks will have to throw a max at KD, possibly trade their pieces for AD, and hope that they can sell AD and any other FA s on another year to wait for KD s return from injury. That is a tall order. Alternatively, they can ride their hopes on RJ s development, and perhaps Kevin Knox can aspire to be more than a squire.   


**The AD/NOLA Fiasco -** quite possibly the biggest winners from all this. With KD out for what should be most of the year in the West, many more WC teams can put together packages for an AD deal. Namely Blazers and the Nuggets. NOLA still has the luxury of moving him out East too, to Knicks/Nets, and Boston. NOLA is sitting on a great place to be for a trade.   


**Lakers -** This is a double edged sword. Do they outbid all offers and give up their core and picks for AD, or do they capitalize on KD s absence and ride it out with their core and wait for 2020  Lakers can now afford to  gamble on the health and development of their players, since the core +Lebron if healthy should be able to challenge GSW on paper granted they rebuilt their roster right.  However that plan fails if anyone of the key young guys or LBJ gets injured. On the bright side, LBJ can recruit  KD for some appearances in Space Jam 2 since he ll have the time.   


**Warriors -**  This is heavy. IF KD opts in, do they really want to go through another year of both no KD and no depth  alternatively if he does bolt for another team, they could very well return to 2016 form with the cap space to build their depth again. Do they gamble on KD, and hope Steph/Klay/Dray can carry to another WCF berth with poor depth    


  
So many narratives at play, how do you think this will end

1325,t3_bz8040,r/nba,  Disclaimer  While my heart aches for Kevin Durant and how horrible his injury was I do not mean to dehumanize him at all with this thread. This thread will be about how Kevin Durant the player s injury will effect the NBA landscape.  

Just now on ESPN Brian Windhorst said that this injury could ve just changed the entire landscape of the NBA. At first I thought he was being a little dramatic and then it kinda hit me all at once that a bunch of teams cleared up cap space to sign this guy and now he may have suffered a DeMarcus Cousins or John Wall level injury where he may not come back till December at the earliest. 

In a scenario where we may not see Kevin Durant play until next year at the very least do you think Kevin Durant accepts his player option from the Warriors now  Do other teams throw max money at him  Let me know what other thoughts you may have on the situation. 
1326,t3_bzbsa2,r/nba, Doris Burke on KD re-injury   the worse we think could happen is that he could tweak the calf  ù
1327,t3_bzef1u,r/nba,  FiveThirtyEight  NBA players with Achilles tears typically needed almost 9 months to recover, and they tended to have a significant reduction in both playing time and performance in the season following the trauma, according to a list compiled by  ESPNStatsInfo. 
1328,t3_bzca50,r/nba,  Haynes  Prior to coming back, he went through four weeks with a medical team, and it was thorough and it was experts and multiple MRIs and multiple doctors, and we felt good about the process,  ù Myers said. He was cleared to play tonight. That was a collaborative decision.  ù

Big news for the Warriors. KD is now a game-time decision. This is the complaint some previously had, as   Questionable   wasn t that forthcoming, whereas game-timing decision is a larger indication that he ll play. 
1331,t3_bzajsp,r/nba,  Link to tweet  https //twitter.com/MarcJSpearsESPN/status/1138362246835429376 s=20 

If this is true, it shows how hard KD was working to try and come back, further dispelling the notion that he was prioritizing free agency over the playoffs. But it also shows the strain on his body that probably contributed to the injury. And with that many workouts, it makes sense that the medical staff and trainers thought they had enough info to evaluate KD and clear him to play.

What are your thoughts on two-a-days at this stage of his calf injury  Could this have contributed to tonight s achilles injury  

Would you have thought two-a-day workouts and 1v1/2v2 practices were enough to evaluate a player s readiness to return  

And what are your thoughts on the coaching staff s decision to let KD determine when he should sit during the game

After shooting 50  from 3-point range during the first 3 games, he s shooting just 9.1  in games 4 and 5; he went 1-for-7 in game 4 and 0-for-4 tonight during game 5.

1346,t3_bzedk1,r/nba, A Rehabing KD, if diagnosed with an Achillies tear, is in a path where he may not be able to play until long after ASB minimum, if at all next year. As the  1 target of many a team, his signing for max slot becomes now the highest risk of any team. Along with his ability to opt in for 30 million, its no question that his best path for money is with the warriors.
Now the market has to adapt to this news  
The Knicks, Lakers and Clippers are problably the Teams looking to hunt one of these big agents but i think that somthing even bigger is going to happen with trades  KDs absence will be felt as basically giving Rebuilds saftey to take risks  Dallas, Denver, Milwuakee,  and teams going all in to really expedite their win-now posititon/Ease Tax Burden  OKC, Boston, and Houston are the number ones in this position . Thats not counting out Portland, who i think are also in one of the best spots to make a jump post dynasty warriors. I assure that one huge gamble will happen this year to one of these six teams to really get the ball rolling, and that one of those top 3 picks arent going to to stay with those teams now.

1359,t3_bzdj51,r/nba, Context 

In the initial stages of his postseason absence, the narrative circulating was that the Warriors were a better team without him. Toward the middle of his time being sidelined, some took issue with him remaining in the locker room and not sitting on the bench with his team. In the latter stages of his rehab, the chatter shifted to the possibility that he was milking the injury to prove to the Warriors how desperately he was needed to win another championship.

Family, teammates and confidants routinely checked on Durant during his quest to rejoin his guys on the court. Each time, Durant explained that he was working to speed up the process but was still experiencing discomfort pushing off his right foot, league sources told Yahoo Sports.

Sources described Durant as being in agony because he was unable to help his teammates.

Did Atlanta had an all-star this year because Vince Carter played for them 

Can we say the Hornets were pathetic even tho they had an all-star PG coming of the bench in Tony Parker, should the Mavericks feel ashamed because they missed the playoffs with a former FVMP and multiple time all-star Nowitzki

&gt; I don t anticipate anything of major significance other than meeting with Zion and his family. I never anticipate that. I m open minded. I think we all are. There s a point at which we act. If things evolve in such a way that it s time for us to make a decision relative to Anthony Davis or any other part of the organization, we will. But we re not in a hurry to do anything. We don t feel there s a time sensitivity to anything we re talking about. That includes AD s desire to stay or not stay. It s not something there s a shot clock on.

1376,t3_bzej8t,r/nba,Genuine NBA Rules Question
1377,t3_bz0vjt,r/nba, Golden State and the NBA have filed for new logo designs at various trademark offices, ahead of the move to the new arena. The bridge logo has been tweaked, with fewer cables on the bridge and new horizontal lines running up the tower. The font only has serifs on the left side of letters. The   Bay   logo will likely replace the current   Town   logo, and the   W   in the secondary logo appears to be two-toned.

  

Like most trademark filings, these images were submitted in black and white. They will obviously be in colour when in actual use.

1380,t3_bzegna,r/nba,Has your decision changed as to who you want to win the finals since KD  s injury last night 
1381,t3_bzbmai,r/nba, He basically gave them a rich man s role player performance. If jonas jerebko went 3/3 from downtown, we would name him as one of the heroes of the game

He also, as per usual,when you add an all time great player to the equation, opened up a lot of things for the rest of his team while he was on the court. Highest +/- on the team if im not mistaken.

Warriors would not win game 5 without his contributions.

Hey everyone - we got a recent update that Michael Porter Jr. has been dealing with foot drop  ù after his multiple back surgeries and will wear a brace for summer league. I detailed the condition, the brace  He s likely using to help with it, where he stands in his rehab, and what it means for his career  including a recent example of a player who dealt with the same issue .

For reference, I m a DPT with my own sports rehab &amp; performance clinics in West LA and Valencia, CA. Feel free to hit me with questions.

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I ve hard coded subtitles so sound isn t required.

You can find the original video on the 3CB Performance youtube channel.

Video of the incident linked above. Raps fans really coming unhinged this series, these people are kind of scary. Weird how Canada has a good reputation, but their fans have been the polar opposite. 
1389,t3_bzdml0,r/nba,I believe with KD s injury he is going to 100  resign with the warriors like cousins did for rehabbing.
1390,t3_bz6c7s,r/nba, I don t know how many times I ve seen someone slightly hit his wrist and he falls down like someone pushed him.

It s a smart play so I don t fault him, but what I don t like is the double standard.

And just to clarify, I m talking more in a reputation sense. He obviously gets hate the moment he does it, but it s not something people hold against him generally. 
1391,t3_bzd9z4,r/nba, I don t think I m alone in saying that going into last night s game I wanted the Raptors to beat the Warriors with a healthy KD. In order to be the best, you should be able to beat the best right  Instead what we got was 

1  A serious KD injury  probable Achilles tear 
2  Toronto heel turn for cheering said injury
3  Warriors win regardless. Although on this point I found myself rooting for them as the game went on.

I feel like we were robbed of an epic finals conclusion and I don t know who I want to win anymore. Anyone else feel the same  
1392,t3_bz7kbp,r/nba, I dont think losing 2 timeouts is a good enough reason. The Raptors had so much momentum and Kawhi was hot. They are up 6 and he calls a  timeout. Only way that works is if they come out of the timeout with a good play and easy bucket to go up 8, but they dont  No play at all  Then they fail to score the majority of their remaining possessions. The Raptors literally iced themselves. The warriors had one timeout left and if the Raptors kept the momentum going it would ve forced the warriors in a touch position. That was so hard to watch. Not to mention the last play was horrid.

Edit  based on comments below it sounds like the players called it. If they felt tired then okay that s fine. But they definitely didnt not bring any efficiency or scoring  to the offense after that. 
1393,t3_bzebtj,r/nba, I have followed baseball for quite a while.

  

There are four memorable chokes in the 21st century postseason, namely the 2002 choke of SF Giants, 2003 choke of Chicago Cubs,  both under Dusty Baker  2004 choke of NY Yankees  Joe Torre  and 2011 choke of Texas Rangers  Ron Washington .

  

Each time they got very close to winning the World Series or reaching there, but choked for a variety of reasons.

  

None of the managers named above every got close to their glory. Dusty Baker was solid but never reached world series; ditto to Joe Torre, a Yankees legendary manager but ending his career with a whimper.  Ron Washington got into some sex issue and disappeared.

No team which got so close to winning and let it slip to its fingers ever recovers.

SF Giants won its World Series in 2010, Chicago Cubs finally in 2016, NY Yankees 2009. Texas Rangers is still far away from reaching the World Series. All with different managers.

  

===

  

The imperative is that Nick Nurse will choke, the Raptors will return to Jurassic Park and never hard again, Kawhi will leave and Curry will win the NBA Final MVP.

  

Durant will be credited, cheered, and forgotten. After one year of paying him 31m as a bonus for the championship, he will be let go, become a journeyman,and will probably not enter the Hall of Fame like Derrick Rose. Many years later, when The GS Warriors might need some image changes, he will be given some title to become a spokesman for the team.

  

The Curry-Thompson team, who will continue to be dominant, will enter to the pantheon of basketball like Jordan and Pippen.

  

That is the high probability outcome. There might be exceptions to this scenario, but it is the most likely one. 
1394,t3_bz6e22,r/nba, I have some theories 

1. Serge and the ball have a torrid, yet tender relationship and he wants to remind it how much it means to him. 

2. There  s chapstick on the ball, and Ibaka struggles with chapped lips.

3. Ibaka subscribes to the Schrute Disease Prevention method, and is building up his immune system by exposing himself to germs. 

4. It bothers the free throw shooter, and makes it more difficult for them to convert the penalty shot. 

5. Ibaka likes the way the ball smells, and pretends to kiss it instead to avoid revealing his kink. 

6. The ball is kissing Ibaka, and he doesn  t want to be rude. 

Let me know what you think, I  m leaning  2 
1395,t3_bzd7mp,r/nba, I hear a lot of KD should just stay with the warriors, collect his check and recover without doing anything, but why tho  
1396,t3_bzb7v5,r/nba, I think the cases of KD, IT and Kawhi show that in the long run, you are better off ignoring the media, team officials  and even team mates  regarding injury and rehab. 
1397,t3_bzbj0l,r/nba, I took KD for granted, and this injury was truly a wake up call for other players that we, as fans of the game, take for granted. 
1398,t3_bz9doa,r/nba, I was just wondering, in light of the KD injury, should there be a 3rd party organization evaluating player health and fitness to deem them court ready  This is aside from the team s medical staff.


Obviously the goal is to remove organizational bias from the decision whether or not to play a player. What pros and cons do you see from this  
1399,t3_bzed64,r/nba,I  m seeing all these posts all of a sudden saying we should donate to KD  s charity because of the sacrifice he made.
1400,t3_bzaudm,r/nba,If KD didn t force himself to comeback when would he really have been healthy 
1401,t3_bzbims,r/nba, If Knicks are smart, they should be putting max contract on KD s table fast as possible

1403,t3_bzdp9s,r/nba, If the Warriors came back 3-1, would this be better than the Cavs in 2016  
1404,t3_bzahx6,r/nba, if they lose this chip, he gonna take another pay cut for one more year 
1405,t3_bze8mf,r/nba, I m currently training as a foot and ankle surgical resident and have treated Achilles injuries both conservatively and surgically, don t want to give too much away here lol 

**What is the Achilles tendon **

You have three main muscles in the calf, the medial and lateral gastrocnemius on the surface and the soleus under them, referred to as the triceps surae  image  https //rontherapist.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/14073272_237095860019204_936413939_n.jpg . The Achilles tendon is where those three muscles combine to attach to the heel bone aka the calcaneus  image  https //www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Insertional-Achilles-Tendonitis-Diagram2.jpg . 

**What does the Achilles tendon do **

When the triceps surae contract, they shorten and pull the heel upwards, called plantarflexion. Plantarflexion is important for walking, jumping, running, etc. and is where the power to push off comes from. The opposite of plantarflexion is dorsiflexion, where the heel comes down and the toes go up in the air. Dorsiflexion is what stretches the triceps surae and the Achilles tendon. 

**How does the Achilles rupture, classically **

The Achilles tendon is incredibly strong and resilient. It normally ruptures under high load. In most cases this is when someone is trying to push-off/plantarflex as the ankle is strongly dorsiflexing. For example, f someone is planting their foot and the heel is coming to the ground, but at the same time they are trying to push off  jump, change directions, etc. . The heel is moving down towards the ground with high velocity, but the calf muscles are trying to pull it back up to come off the ground. This push and pull on the tendon will cause immense load and can lead to partial tears or a rupture.

Think about a rubber band. If someone is pulling it one direction and you suddenly try to pull against them with all of your strength it  s likely going to snap. 

Classic literature says that the Achilles tends to tear in the watershed  ù area. This is a few cm above where it attaches to the heel bone. Watershed means an area with decreased blood flow and thickness, which predisposes the area to tears.

**Why are people saying that the trainers/doctors probably knew it right away in the locker room **

You can do a Thompson test. Have the patient lay on their stomach and hang their feet off the table. Squeeze the calf to simulate a contraction. If the Achilles is ruptured, it can  t pull the heel and plantarflex the foot.  image  https //litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Thompson-Test-1962.jpg 

Other tests include just asking the patient to plantarflex on their own. Different variations of tests like the Thompson test. A palpable defect in the tendon or noticeable swelling and loss of visualization of the tendon  image  https //image.slidesharecdn.com/tarupture-140227012909-phpapp02/95/tendoachilles-rupture-and-its-management-13-638.jpg cb=1393464613 .

**Can a strain  tear  of the calf muscles lead to this injury **

Likely not. If someone had a tear in the muscle belly of the calf, they  d have pain and likely not be able to put that high stress load on the tendon. It  s likely that KD  s lower calf strain  ù was actually some sort of minor Achilles tendinopathy  injury  to begin.

**Why I don t think it s a full rupture**

https //imgur.com/a/GBXZuGu

I did notice the KD was able to kind of plantarflex his foot when he was on the ground and even walking off the court which **might** be indicative of a less severe injury, maybe a partial tear. That being said, that s only something you could know on exam and imaging so we ll have to wait and see. 
1406,t3_bz917o,r/nba, In an attempt to deter from all of the discussions on achilles injuries, Raptors fans cheering  and player responses , Kevin Durant s player option and the Warriors  medical staff, who has been a stand-out bench player for you this series 

Either on Golden State, Toronto, or both  
1407,t3_bzayaq,r/nba, In Game 5, Steph Curry passed some notable greats in Finals scoring.

5.  Kevin Love, Brandon Ingram  5 and a first to the Pelicans, Kyle Kuzma,  4 to Cavs  http //tradenba.com/trades/H1JyabhAN 

  

Just looking for feedback. 
1409,t3_bzao3x,r/nba, In the 2019 finals, the home team is 1-4 . 
1410,t3_bzej69,r/nba, In the past 20 years, 10 teams closed out the championship on the road 
1411,t3_bze9hq,r/nba, Injuries, fatigue, and   complacency   to an extent all are factors to teams not being able to run off multiple titles in a row

The fact that Jordan was able to 3-peat twice is an insane feat. And he did all this while averaging 40+ mpg in every single playoff run he s ever had. He even played all 82 regular season games in each of the 3 years of the second 3-peat at ages 32-34

Now imagine if he also had the luxury of a medical staff optimizing your sleep and diet, modern medicine and recovery tools, and if he didn t spend his off days gambling and smoking cigars 
1412,t3_bze9l3,r/nba, Interesting stat from last night  s game  The warriors won by 1 point while making 20 3s to Toronto  s 8. There have now been 17 playoff games where a team has made 12 more 3s than their opponent, and the average scoring margin before this game was 20.6. 
1413,t3_bzdsz2,r/nba,Is it possible KD opts-in and delay his free agency to 2020 
1414,t3_bzbg4e,r/nba,Is there a possibility Kevin Durant doesn  t opt out of his contract 
1415,t3_bz8s7d,r/nba, It  s a probably way too early to ask this, but now that we know Kevin Durant most likely has a torn Achilles what is his contractual future going to look like  

He has a player option for the 2019-2020 season. Do you think he  ll opt in  If he doesn  t opt in will teams still offer him the max  
1416,t3_bzcy9v,r/nba, It  s deep enough in the playoffs to say that players like Jerebko, Mckinnie, Bell, even Iggy, Livingston and Boogie are NOT going to give you reliable offense.  The Warriors played great defense on Kawhi and great overall team defense, but also Kawhi those first 3 quarters wasn  t feeling it.  Siakim could  ve played better.

Toronto is going to find a way to get points out of everyone next game.  I see Kawhi, Siakim, and Gasol playing much better.  That  s the problem, Golden State has no room to get better.  Offensively they had the luck of Durant bursting out like 13 points and they only managed to get 106 points.  I feel like that  s their ceiling, 100-108 points.  The Raptors know how to make adjustments.

I wouldn  t be surprised that the Warriors play as well as they can, but Raptors win 120-108.  I wonder if there ever will be criticism of the Warriors for not focusing on putting more shooters on the bench instead of just relying so heavily on the Big 4. 
1417,t3_bzc2ez,r/nba, It s ridiculous how dramatic this thread is and how everyone is jumping to massive conclusions and switching sides just because they are on the other side of the fence. Yes it was disgusting to see but when massive crowds get together for such moments, it s very typical for that snowball effect to take place and people joining cheers. I m pretty sure most regretted it and felt bad once they understood what really transpired  following the KD chants and etc. Y all need to relax. Plus, KD is a true warrior dude showed zero facial expression of pain or otherwise, which probably made people assume he s just not ready to play instead of being physically hurt or worsening the injury. I don t support what happened, but everyone switching sides or praying for the downfall of Raptors is same cloth mentality.

P.S. Not really here to defend or justify, but it s just easy to see how it transpired the way it did if you know anything about psychology and crowds.

In order to determine whether or not an incentive counts against the cap you have to look at whether or not the player achieved the incentive in the previous season, despite being an all-star in 2016-17 he only played 60 games which made him ineligible for the incentive, this means that his in-season cap hit would be the same as his base pay in 2017-18.

In the 2017-18 season he played over 65 Games with 25.0 MPG while also making the all-star team, this means that he achieved the incentive in that season meaning his salary goes up 200,000. This is applied at the end of the season, and only for tax purposes.

The Raptors ended the 2017-2018 season with 116,791,502 in salary ~2.4m below the luxury tax line, meaning that even if they won the finals in 17-18 whey would have stayed out of the tax.

However, Lowry achieved the all-star incentive in 2017-18 meaning his cap hit for 2018-19 goes up 200,000 to 31,200,000 and that s why if you look at any cap website they have the 31.2m number.

On top of reaching the all-star incentive, Lowry has also gotten the Conference Finals and NBA Finals incentives, which adds 1,000,000 and possibly could add 200,000 with another win. 

This balloons the Raptors salary up to 136,922,867  or 137,122,867 with a ring  with them being in the 10-15m range of being over the tax where each dollar costs 2.50 dollars in tax.

He was one of the few bright spots in the Bosh era, came to Toronto from Spain as an FA, couldn t shoot and couldn t defend, but he refused to give up and through hard work and determination, got better at everything but defending.

Turned himself into an excellent 3pt shooter, amazing FT shooter, was insanely efficient and just barely missed the 50-40-90 club in 2008-09, and was an excellent play maker.

Despite repeated attempts to replace him throughout the years, he just kept beating them out, without causing any chemistry issues, and he became one of my favourite players of all time in the process.

With the exception of maybe Dominique Wilkins, players do not usually regain their pre-Achilles projected level of play.

Here s an article from last year when Boogie joined up with the Dubs.

https //www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/1/27/16940178/demarcus-cousins-achilles-injury-golden-state-warriors-this-is-the-worst

EDIT  I m not saying KD won t be back to playing at a high level. He s, at the very least, one of the greatest shooters ever. That s a skill that can translate even if you don t jump a lot or dribble a lot. He could technically play into his late 30s with just that. 
1462,t3_bzcq19,r/nba, Outside of the last 5 mins of the 4th quarter, did Lowry outplay Kawhi  
1463,t3_bzeac2,r/nba, Paraphrased one section in title. In the latest podcast, Nate Duncan outlines a few of the issues surrounding putting KD on the court last night. It s a great listen, and I ve transcribed below the segment that deals with this  removed a Ums etc., or anywhere I was unaware of what was being said ie. one writer s name   

    Dunc d On Podcast - 2019 NBA Finals Game 5, KD Injury   https //www.spreaker.com/user/10451190/duncd-on-190611-final_1    

&gt;So, a number of articles came out  ¶ Amick went further saying there was frustration among the Warriors   players  ¶. There definitely were Warriors   players carping to the media about the fact that KD was not back yet - and a lot of people saying on social media   òoh because he wanted to be a free agent   and   òwhy even bother coming back at all   and painting him as a malinger and   òhe didn  t even want to come back   and all this, so it  s rare that I  ll do this but let me play this clip here from yesterday  s show  

&gt;Every single time just about that people, whether it  s teammates whether its the media, whatever, question a guy for supposedly being a malinger and being healthy and not playing, it just hasn  t ended up well, whether it  s Bill Walton, whether it  s Loul Deng in 2009 when he turned out to have a stress fracture in his leg, whether it was Kawhi last year, especially someone like Kevin Durant - you only have so many times in your life you can play in an NBA Finals - it  s one thing if its like Jerome James who just had one hot playoffs and then got a big deal and then didn  t want to play anymore. Kevin Durant clearly loves basketball, that  s what he lives for - I would be really really surprised if he is healthy enough to play and just not doing it. So, is this enough now  Can we stop doing this thing where we question whether guys are actually healthy enough to play when they sit out and I don  t know what was said by the Warriors and their doctors to KD, I don  t know if they put pressure on him directly, certainly KD reads the media.

&gt;It was quite obvious just from watching him that he wasn t entirely comfortable pushing off of that calf and then I thought knowing what the risk was to him, or maybe that he just wasn t 100 , because it was said - Slater had this   òif this were the regular season it would be another week or two before he came back    and so if that s the case, you have to put him in positions where he s not going to stress that out, and that  s something that could have or should have been communicated to him as well  Duncan talking re  person experience with calf injury   ¶ once I saw KD bringing the ball up and getting pressured up at half court, one time he tried to get by Siakim and Siakim got called for a foul, but he clearly didn t feel comfortable trying to push off and go by him and then they did it again and they switched and they put Ibaka on him and Ibaka is pressuring up and that s what led to the injury. Anybody should know this before the game that when you put him in situations where he s facing the basket, where he really has to push off by pushing that right leg behind him, you re putting him into a difficult position, that maybe it  s not a question of reinjury, but  He s not going to be able to do that really well and so to call plays where he s bringing the ball up floor was really just not smart at all. And you don  t know that this is what  s going to happen, but put him in the post - the one time they put him in the post he got double teamed, have him come off a screen - they did that once, and have him be a spot up shooter, and maybe as he works into the game, which he did to some degree you can try some of that other stuff, but Curry was out of the game, they felt like they wanted to have him handle the ball but, the way he looked I really thought that was not a good decision. And maybe he said,   òalright, I  m fine I can do that,   between him and then,  He s cleared so you want to say   òoh its KD,  He s back, we  re gonna just do the normal stuff  , but that seemed really short sighted to me and I was saying that live on the show before the injury happened - that it just really didn  t make sense to use him that way.

&gt;Sliding your feet, jumping off you  re feet, you  re fine there. That  s much easier and really you don  t necessarily need to make that kind of a motion that often. Yeah  He s not gonna be 1000  KD, but putting him into that situation where  He s pressured up - and credit the Raptors for - and they  ve done this all series - for making nothing easy for him either. I don  t credit them for injuring him, but for making him work. That was a great philosophy for them.

1480,t3_bz8man,r/nba, Serious question. Is there any way it  s not as bad as it  s being made out to be and there  s a chance he can play to start next year or maybe a month or two in   

Prayers up for KD. 
1481,t3_bzd9ee,r/nba, Serious question  are the nets allowed to sign and trade DLO, or extend and trade  
1482,t3_bz6vuj,r/nba,shoot shoot shoot shoot
1483,t3_bzdf2v,r/nba,Should Demarcus Cousins have been called for that moving screen on the final warriors possession of the game 
1484,t3_bzco12,r/nba,Should Nurse have put Ibaka in with Gasol last night for the last play of the game 
1485,t3_bzdh5e,r/nba, So I know Demarcus Cousins is easy to make fun of, but the people making fun of how he played down the stretch last night are ridiculous and honestly I don  t think they know basketball.

1. He was fantastic last night. An efficient 14 and 6 in 20 minutes is awesome. I honestly thought he could have taken a few more jumpers in the 4th to spread the floor but overall he had a great game and provided a huge lift after KD went down.

2. The guy is still injured. This is a similar injury to what Oladipo and Kawhi had.

3. I would say 2 out of the 3 calls against him were either bad luck or a bad call. The goaltending on Lowry was definitely a goaltending and the right call. Honestly he should never guard a PG straight up so I put that on Kerr  I know it  s a switch and all that but still I think that  s a scheme issue not a Cousins issue . The offensive basket interference was a millisecond from being the best play of the game. Certain angles almost made it look like he timed it perfectly but I do think he was there barely early so I am going to chalk that up to bad luck. Honestly if the refs hadn  t called it and went back to review it may have held up as a tip slam. Also offensive basket interference isn  t that big of a deal to get it called on you. It just gives the other team a defensive rebound really. The third play which was garbage was the moving screen. That whistle should have been swallowed. I bet we saw that screen 50 times in the game and they decide to call it in the final 20 seconds. Pretty much every screen in the NBA is a moving screen.

I never thought I  d be a Cousins apologist but the guy deserves a crazy amount of praise for how he played last night and I want him to get his credit. 
1486,t3_bz026a,r/nba, So it wasn t 5 minutes like some people inferred, as the video initially showing him entering the arena was quickly followed by the video of him leaving. 

  

SportsCenter had the timestamps. Just for clarity s sake. Now is a good time to tune into ESPN, btw. Tonnes of stuff going down, and I m usually anti-ESPN and avoid everything they put out. 
1487,t3_bz3tp1,r/nba, So I ve seen people saying that Golden State didn t need Durant to win, and could have replaced him with a 3&amp;D role player. 

Durant has averaged 30ppg on 60 TS  vs the Houston Rockets, a team that took the Warriors to 7 games the past two seasons. In your opinion which players could have replicated his production and why  
1488,t3_bz7y0w,r/nba, So obviously this is regarding the DMC putback dunk. Is the ball   in the cylinder   if any part of the ball is in the cylinder  Or is it if the center of the ball is in the cylinder  I always thought it was the second, but I went to do my research to confirm. I found  this  https //www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2qk9u7/what_exactly_is_in_the_cylinder/  old reddit thread which is pretty inconclusive, with no sources.  The rulebook  https //official.nba.com/rule-no-11-basket-interference-goaltending/  doesn t clarify. It just says 
&gt; Touch any ball from within the playing area when it is above the basket ring and within the imaginary cylinder.

That s not the whole rule, just part b of i parts. What does   within the imaginary cylinder   mean.

To me, it looked like the sideline view was the only one looking horizontally at the rim. It showed the center of the ball outside of the cylinder, but much of the ball still in the cylinder. /r/nba refs, should this have counted  
1489,t3_bzafw0,r/nba, Sorry for my European ignorance but I really do not understand the meaning of the national anthem before the game. It is a club competition. Has it always been this way and do you know is it a thing anywhere outside US/Canada  

I don t want to sound rude but in my opinion playing the anthem before every game diminishes its worth and meaning. 
1490,t3_byt7fp,r/nba, Source from  The Athletic  https //theathletic.com/1018601/2019/06/09/thompson-with-the-warriors-on-the-brink-the-ball-and-the-game-has-to-be-in-steph-currys-hands/ . Relevant part listed here since article is behind a paywall 

&gt; In Game 4, the game was tied at 61 with 4 29 left in the third quarter. The next eight Warriors possessions included missed jumpers from Alfonzo McKinnie, Cook  two  and Kevon Looney plus a turnover by Green. Curry missed a floater and drew two fouls that led to four free throws. The three points that came from them was all the Warriors scored over the next three minutes as the Raptors built a nine-point lead.

&gt; **A mediocre shot,  ù Curry said, from me or Klay in those situations, to try to go back at their runs, are missed opportunities. We  ve got to slow it down a little bit and try to be more choreographed a little bit instead of trying to fight fire with fire.  ù**

&gt; In those moments, Curry needs the ball in his hands. That  s how all of the options the Raptors have to guard come in play. Isolation. Manipulating screens to get past the first line of defense. Getting to the rim and drawing fouls. Pulling up from 3. All of it is possible with the ball in his hands.

&gt; Without the ball, the Raptors are just smothering the Warriors   sets, making sure Curry doesn  t get it back and forcing the other Warriors to make them pay. Durant can do that, but he may not even be on the floor. Thompson can do that, but  He s best in catch-and-shoot situations when the offense is being created for him, especially on a tender hamstring. 
1491,t3_byzvop,r/nba, Source  https //www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26941750/pelicans-open-multi-team-davis-deal 

Griffin has offered teams no firm timetable on needing a completed deal, but he has indicated that he prefers the acquisition of 2019 draft picks be completed days prior to the June 20 event, in Brooklyn, league sources said.

This likely means that Anthony Davis will be traded   days prior   to the NBA Draft. Get ready to F5 as hard as you can in the next 10 days boys. 
1492,t3_byzwu7,r/nba, Source  https //www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26941750/pelicans-open-multi-team-davis-deal

Griffin is pursuing a combination of assets that include an All-Star player, a young player with All-Star potential and two first-round picks, league sources said. Those wants are on a sliding scale. For example, the better the player, the softer the asks on the draft picks -- and vice versa.

It seems like the three team trade is going to have a lot of moving pieces of Griffin gets the kind of deal he s looking for. Probably wants a Kawhi Leonard-level trade, possibly a little more. 
1493,t3_bzeijm,r/nba,Sources  Grizzlies to hire Bucks  Jenkins as HC
1494,t3_bzeh5t,r/nba, Sports forums are flooded with comments today about how terrible it was that the Golden State medical team cleared Durant to play. The last comment I read was    The entire staff be fired. KD should not have played last night - PERIOD.   I m sure a bunch of you made comments that Durant shouldn t have been cleared to play and even if he had been, he should have chosen to sit the game out.

Now fall back to last year. The Spurs doctors medically cleared Kawhi to play. He said he was still in pain and that his private doctor said he was still injured. FANS on this subsection and in every sports forum absolutely crucified Kawhi. Sports talk radio hosts destroyed him. Said he had no heart, no loyalty, was a cancer  and of course, that he was overrated.  Even coach POP and a couple of his teammates ripped Kawhi apart in interviews. 

So it is interesting to see the different narrative here.  

Also, on a side note, it is also funny how fickle NBA fans are. A year ago, almost all of you hated Kawhi  but after this NBA playoffs he s become one of the 2-3 most loved players in the world. A week ago, everybody who wasn t a Golden State fan hated Durant, nick named The Snake  but he gets hurt, and now everybody loves him

One dude on Reddit actually said   Durant risked it all       .dude is a pro athlete, with a couple hundred million dollars in the bank, will miss one year  where he will still get paid 31 million dollars  and will still come back and no doubt be an All Star and get a huge contract. Risked it all  He didn t go off to fight a war or he didn t jump in the middle of a grizzly bear mauling his friend. He chose to play a basketball game.  Trust me, KD will be alright.  Lots of athletes get injured and miss time. 

And yes, downvote me all you want. You know everything I said was true. The same people destroying Kawhi last year are now destorying GS s medical staff. Too funny. 
1495,t3_bzbd30,r/nba, Steph s 3 to tie the game at 106 or Klay s to put Warriors ahead hold on, did Warriors score 109 again     

I personally think Steph s 3 was more critical as the stakes are higher if he missed. Also of course his shot difficulty is much higher. It also turned the momentum in GSW favor.

Kudos to Iguodala too, too pass it out of the paint without hesitation, leading to Klay s wide open 3 while Kawhi fly past. 
1496,t3_bzb4ni,r/nba, Steve Kerr said Durant would play in   short spurts   before the game then played him 12 of the first 14 minutes 
1497,t3_bzbvq1,r/nba, Steve Kerr was quoted as saying the medical staff told him that Durant couldn  t hurt his calf any further. I am not sure if this is a misquote because I can  t find it at the moment.


In 2012, the Pittsburgh Penguins fired their entire medical staff after they mis-diagnosed a fractured vertebrae in Sidney Crosby  s neck.  ESPN article  https //www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/8183221/pittsburgh-penguins-fire-longtime-physician-charles-burke-medical-staff 


Could a similar thing happen to the Warriors medical staff this offseason 


My sincere apologies to Durant and the Warriors for how the Raptors audience reacted to the injury. It was extremely un-classy. When I saw the threads on the subject I was hoping the titles were a joke and the fans were cheering out of respect, like how it is a common theme at sporting events to cheer out of encouragement and sympathy when a player gets up after an injury or is carted off on the medical golf cart  like in football .


Edit  encourage to encouragement 
1498,t3_bz7quf,r/nba, Strawpoll  https //strawpoll.com/8s4yss7z

Durant showed a little bit of what the Warriors would have looked like if he was out there, but he clearly wasn t at 100 . Keep in mind, Lowry, Kawhi, and Siakam would all be playing at 100  as well, same goes for Iggy, Klay, Looney, ect . Who you got

But I mean  . didn  t he retain all-star caliber skill, have gem moments, yadda yadda 

KD needs to come back, man. In some ways, I feel like if anyone could it would be him. But in other ways, I have a nasty feeling it wouldn  t be him.

That said, there is an automatic TV timeout at the 3, 6, and 9 mins to go marks of the 4th quarter, with the one at the 3 mins to go mark always being an official s timeout and not charged to a team. So the first dead ball after the 3 min mark, the Warriors would ve had a TV timeout to regroup. As such, even if the Raps don t take that timeout themselves and go through with that possession, the likely outcome of the situation is that the Warriors, still having two fouls to give at that point, pick up one during the Raps  next trip down the floor to force a dead ball and the TV timeout. so the Warriors would ve had a free chance to regroup regardless, the only question being if that one extra possession in between could ve been enough to swing things.

I don t know how accurate this is since that s my understanding of how TV timeouts work, even though there have been rule changes in the past few years regarding timeouts  no more  20 s, for example . That said, I feel like people are overlooking this if it is the case. 
1504,t3_bz2xbu,r/nba, The NBA Finals are not the only basketball finals going on right now. Game 1 of the Greek Basket League finals has just finished with Panathinaikos beating Promitheas 101-77. The series is expected to be a 3-0 sweep for the Greens and finished the regular season with a 24-2 record.

But I m not here to talk much about what is happening on the court. This season has seen so much going on outside of the game itself, and it s a drama that you really could never see happening in the NBA.

**Background**

The Greek Basket League is dominated by two clubs since the 90s   Olympiacos  https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_B.C.   aka OSFP, Legend, the Red and White  and  Panathinaikos  https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panathinaikos_B.C.   aka PAO, the Greens . These two clubs have cemented their status on the back of their Euroleague participation which brings in a lot of revenue and the heated rivalry the two clubs share across multiple sports. No other team comes close to these two  in the last 25 seasons, only 1 time has a team other than these two won the title, and only 7 times has the final *not* been played between them. You have to go back to 2004 to find the last time any another team made the final. As a side note, the clubs are *coached by David Blatt and Rick Pitino*, respectively.

This year Olympiacos missed the final in spectacular fashion. But there was no historic, upset victory by a lower seeded team which got them there. Instead what happened is unheard of in the history of world basketball, and it may get Olympiacos kicked out of the league entirely.

**  We can  t participate in this absurdity.  **

Separate from the regular season, Greece holds a competition called the Greek Cup similar to cup competitions in football/soccer. For those unfamiliar, imagine a March Madness-type competition where every team from the NBA, D-League, all the way down to the your local rec league were put into one bracket.

Olympiacos and Panathinaikos were set to meet in the semifinals of this competition. The   full   match can be seen  here  https //www.youtube.com/watch v=R-n6oJCyW0w . Olympiacos found themselves in foul trouble early, with 3 fouls called against them in just 30 seconds. Olympiacos were humiliated throughout the first half and found themselves down **40-25 at halftime.**

After the typical 10 minutes, Panathinaikos come back on for the half-time shootaround. But Olympiacos are nowhere to be found. There is speculation that perhaps the team is going to forfeit. Eventually,  at 1 07 25 in the video  a countdown clock starts, counting down how long the team have left to come on. What happens next is peak absurdity.

There is an interview with the Panathinaikos GM  1 02 30 . He accuses them of planning to forfeit ahead of time.   It s possible that their players are unpaid, they forfeited and now they say that they hate the refs. Maybe  the owners  wants to sell Olympiacos and throw it all at us and the refs.  ù

Later to Olympiacos General Manager  at 1 10 00 , Christos Stavropoulos.   We have said it again and again and again.   He blames the referees for the state of this game and says   we can  t participate anymore in this absurdity, we can t take it any more .the federation and president should clean up the stink in the game .it s over.  ù When asked about his sending a letter to FIBA to pay special attention to the game tonight, implying that he planned the forfeit ahead of time, Stavropoulos denies it.

The ultimate hilarious ending to this night involved the Panathinaikos GM leaving  a pair of womens  underwear on the visiting teams  bench  https //images.eurohoops.net/2019/02/acc55eda-trakis-string-625x375.jpg .

As a result of this match, Panathinaikos are awarded a 20-0 forfeit win in the Cup, and Olympiacos are deducted 8 points in the regular season standings  equivalent to turning 4 wins into losses - a big penalty considering it is a 26 game season .

**Escalation**

Fast-forward to the last game in the regular season, both teams playing in meaningless games against lower-ranked teams. Olympiacos have found out that the same referee crew from the Cup semifinal were assigned to their regular season game. They announced they would forfeit the game. Greek league rules say that any team forfeiting 2 games in a season, or a single playoff game, gets kicked out of the league and sent to the second division. So if Olympiacos were to forfeit this they would jeopardize not only their place in the Greek league but in Euroleague, who has in the past kicked teams out for poor domestic league placing. 

Separately, the night before the match, a mob of Olympiacos fans showed up to the referees house chanting abuse and threats toward him. He refused to referee the match, and the referees  union demanded a change in the officials for this game, which ultimately occurred. The game went on as normal.

In response and as a protest, Panathinaikos forfeited *their* game and faced a points deduction of their own. The points deductions meant Panathinakos was the 3rd seed and Olympiacos the 6th seed, in an 8 team playoff. Which meant they would be meeting not in the final as they usually do, but in the *first round.*

**The Derby that Wasn t**

In a move that Federation certainly took to cement their authority over the clubs, the same refereeing crew from the teams  Cup meeting was assigned to their first round matchup. Olympiacos was expected to forfeit once again unless the referees were changed, and Panathinakos threatened to forfeit if they were changed. Ultimately, they were not changed, and Olympiacos forfeited their playoff series. Olympiacos are now expected to be relegated to the second division, and their status in the Euroleague is uncertain. 

In the meantime, the team have applied to join another league, the ABA which includes teams from Serbia, Croatia, etc. It is not likely they will be approved. 
1505,t3_bzbhx1,r/nba, The Thunder s fanbase was absolute class last night about the Kevin Durant s injury. I haven t seen one hateful comment from a Thunder fan about KD on r/nba. I also went to r/Thunder and all i saw was people sending good vibes to KD.

Kudos to all of you Thunder fans, my respect for you grows even more.

1508,t3_bz03hl,r/nba, This is actually more rare than you would think. LeBron would claim this feat if not for one game in the 2008 season where he came off the bench.

MJ had quite a few games played as a non-starter. 

Some retired and current players who have done this or are close  data only goes back to 1982 unfortunately  

**Chris Paul - 950/950 games started regular season, 102/102 playoffs**

**Kevin Durant - 849/849 regular season, 138/138 playoffs**

**Damian Lillard - 549/549 regular season, 51/51 playoffs**

LeBron James - 1197/1198 regular season, 239/239 playoffs

Dwight Howard - 1043/1044 regular season, 95/95 playoffs

Blake Griffin - 604/604 regular season, 52/53 playoffs

David Robinson - 985/987 regular season, 123/123 playoffs

Tim Duncan -1389/1392 regular season, 251/251 playoffs

Karl Malone - 1471/1476 regular season, 193/193 playoffs

Steph Curry - 688/694 regular season, 108/110 playoffs

Probably only worth looking at for guys with a substantial   of games played, but post in the comments if you can find any others that have never come off the bench

I noticed that during these finals, both the Raptors and the Warriors have had instances where we ve seen clear dives out on the court from each team, yet there was no call from any official  

When its an obvious flop, how come there is no action taken by the refs  Is this strictly because its the NBA finals

1514,t3_bz7wkz,r/nba, Under 3 minutes, an NBA team gets a maximum of 2 timeouts. The Raptors had 4 with 3 05 remaining. NBA coaches have been doing this all year so they don t waste timeouts. 

It didn t work out, but hindsight is always 20/20. 

Nurse getting blasted by the after the fact crowd as if that single decision cost them the game is absurd.

However, that s not what I m focusing on - I m focusing on that   I told you so/but I was told that   mentality that every fanbase gets when those cheers erupt. That sense of superiority is ridiculous, hypocritical, and just downright ignorant.
